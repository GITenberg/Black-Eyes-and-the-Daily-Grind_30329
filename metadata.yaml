description: During a safari on Venus, a well-to-do couple happen to cross paths with
  a tiny bundle of fur with amazing powers of persuasion. A few weeks later, they
  return to Earth with their fuzzy ball of fur -- which they have christened with
  the sobriquet ""Black Eyes"" -- in tow. Will their new pet adapt to life among humans?
