<h2>By MILTON LESSER</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><i><big>The little house pet from Venus didn't like
New York, so New York had to change.</big></i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He liked</span> the flat cracking
sound of the gun. He liked the
way it slapped back against his
shoulder when he fired. Somehow
it did not seem a part of the dank,
steaming Venusian jungle. Probably,
he realized with a smile, it was
the only old-fashioned recoil rifle
on the entire planet. As if anyone
else would want to use one of those
old bone-cracking relics today! But
they all failed to realize it made
sport much more interesting.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen anything for a
while," his wife said. She had a
young, pretty face and a strong
young body. If you have money
these days, you could really keep a
thirty-five-year-old woman looking
trim.</p>

<p>Not on Venus, of course. Venus
was an outpost, a frontier, a hot,
wet, evil-smelling place that beckoned
only the big-game hunter. He
said, "That's true. Yesterday we
could bag them one after the other,
as fast as I could fire this contraption.
Today, if there's anything bigger
than a mouse, it's hiding in a
hole somewhere. You know what I
think, Lindy?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I think there's a reason for it.
A lot of the early Venusian hunters
said there were days like this. An
area filled with big lizards and cats
and everything else the day before
suddenly seems to clear out, for no
reason. It doesn't make sense."</p>

<p>"Why not? Why couldn't they all
just decide to make tracks for someplace
else on the same day?"</p>

<p>He slapped at an insect that was
buzzing around his right ear, then
mopped his sweating brow with a
handkerchief. His name was Judd
Whitney, and people said he had a
lot of money. Now he laughed, patting
his wife's trim shoulder under
the white tunic. "No, Lindy. It just
doesn't work that way. Not on
Earth and not on Venus, either.
You think there's a pied-piper or
something which calls all the animals
away?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. I don't know much
about those things."</p>

<p>"No. I don't think they went anyplace.
They're just quiet. They
didn't come out of their holes or
hovels or down from the trees. But
why?"</p>

<p>"Well, let's forget it. Let's go
back to camp. We can try again
tomor&mdash;look! Look, there's something!"</p>

<p>Judd followed her pointing finger
with his eyes. Half-hidden by
the creepers and vines clinging to
an old tree-stump, something was
watching them. It wasn't very big
and it seemed in no hurry to get
away.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Lindy wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"Don't know. Never saw anything
like it before. Venus is still
an unknown frontier; the books
only name a couple dozen of the
biggest animals. But hell, Lindy,
that's not <i>game</i>. I don't think it
weighs five pounds."</p>

<p>"It's cute, and it has a lovely
skin."</p>

<p>Judd couldn't argue with that.
Squatting on its haunches, the creature
was about twenty inches tall.
It had a pointed snout and two
thin, long ears. Its eyes were very
big and very round and quite black.
They looked something like the eyes
of an Earthian tarsier, but the tarsier
were bloody little beasts. The
skin was short and stiff and was a
kind of silvery white. Under the
sheen, however, it seemed to glow.
A diamond is colorless, Judd
thought, but when you see it under
light a whole rainbow of colors
sparkle deep within it. This creature's
skin was like that, Judd decided.</p>

<p>"If we could get enough of
them," Lindy was saying, "I'd have
the most unusual coat! Do you
think we could find enough, Judd?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it. Never saw anything
like it before, never heard of anything
like it. You'd need fifty of
'em, anyway. Let's forget about it&mdash;too
small to shoot, anyway."</p>

<p>"No, Judd. I want it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not going to stalk a
five-pound&mdash;hey, wait a minute! I
taught you how to use this rifle, so
why don't you bag it?"</p>

<p>Lindy grinned. "That's a fine
idea. I was a little scared of some of
those big lizards and cats and everything,
but now I'm going to take
you up on it. Here, give me your
gun."</p>

<p>Judd removed the leather thong
from his shoulder and handed the
weapon to her. She looked at it a
little uncertainly, then took the clip
of shells which Judd offered and
slammed it into the chamber. The
little creature sat unmoving.</p>

<p>"Isn't it peculiar that it doesn't
run away, Judd?"</p>

<p>"Sure is. Nothing formidable
about that animal, so unless it has
a hidden poison somewhere, just
about anything in this swamp could
do it in. To survive it would have to
be fast as hell and it would have
to keep running all the time. Beats
me, Lindy."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to get myself
one pelt toward that coat, anyway.
Watch, Judd: is this the way?" She
lifted the rifle to her shoulder and
squinted down the sights toward
the shining creature.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's the way. Only relax.
Relax. Shoulder's so tense
you're liable to dislocate it with the
kick. There&mdash;that's better."</p>

<p>Now Lindy's finger was wrapped
around the trigger and she remembered
Judd had told her to squeeze
it, not to pull it. If you pulled the
trigger you jerked the rifle and
spoiled your aim. You had to
squeeze it slowly....</p>

<p>The animal seemed politely interested.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a delicious languor
stole over Lindy. It possessed her
all at once and she had no idea
where it came from. Her legs had
been stiff and tired from the all-morning
trek through the swamp,
but now they felt fine. Her whole
body was suffused in a warm, satisfied
glow of well-being. And laziness.
It was an utterly new sensation
and she could even feel it
tingling at the roots of her
hair. She sighed and lowered the
rifle.</p>

<p>"I don't want to shoot it," she
said.</p>

<p>"You just told me you did."</p>

<p>"I know, but I changed my mind.
What's the matter, can't I change
my mind?"</p>

<p>"Of course you can change your
mind. But I thought you wanted a
coat of those things."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I do. But I don't
want to shoot it, that's all."</p>

<p>Judd snorted. "I think you have
a streak of softness someplace in
that pretty head of yours!"</p>

<p>"Maybe. I don't know. But I'd
still like the pelt. Funny, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Okay, okay! But don't ask to
use the gun again." Judd snatched
it from her hands. "If you don't
want to shoot it, then I will. Maybe
we can make you a pair of gloves
or something from the pelt."</p>

<p>And Judd pointed his ancient
rifle at the little animal preparing
to snap off a quick shot.
It would be a cinch at this distance.
Even Lindy wouldn't have missed,
if she hadn't changed her mind.</p>

<p>Judd yawned. He'd failed to
realize he was so tired. Not an aching
kind of tiredness, but the kind
that makes you feel good all over.
He yawned again and lowered the
rifle. "Changed my mind," he said.
"I don't want to shoot it, either.
What say we head back for camp?"</p>

<p>Lindy gripped his hand impulsively.
"All right, Judd&mdash;but I had
a brainstorm! I want it for a pet!"</p>

<p>"A pet?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I think it would be the
cutest thing. Everyone would look
and wonder and I'll adore it!"</p>

<p>"We don't know anything about
it. Maybe Earth would be too cold,
or too dry, or maybe we don't have
anything it can eat. There are liable
to be a hundred different strains of
bacteria that can kill it."</p>

<p>"I said I want it for a pet. See?
Look at it! We can call it Black
Eyes."</p>

<p>"Black Eyes&mdash;" Judd groaned.</p>

<p>"Yes, Black Eyes. If you don't do
this one thing for me, Judd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Okay&mdash;okay. But I'm not going
to do anything. You want it, you
take it."</p>

<p>Lindy frowned, looked at him
crossly, then sloshed across the
swamp toward Black Eyes. The
creature waited on its stump until
she came quite close, and then, with
a playful little bound, it hopped
onto her shoulder, still squatting on
its haunches. Lindy squealed excitedly
and began to stroke its silvery
fur.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;month later</span>, they returned
to Earth. Judd and Lindy and
Black Eyes. The hunting trip had
been a success&mdash;Judd's trophies
were on their way home on a slow
freighter, and he'd have some fine
heads and skins for his study-room.
Even Black Eyes had been no trouble
at all. It ate scraps from their
table, forever sitting on its haunches
and staring at them with its big
black eyes. Judd thought it would
make one helluva lousy pet, but he
didn't tell Lindy. Trouble was, it
never did anything. It merely sat
still, or occasionally it would
bounce down to the floor and mince
along on its hind-legs for a scrap
of food. It never uttered a sound. It
did not frolic and it did not gambol.
Most of the time it could have
been carved from stone. But Lindy
was happy and Judd said nothing.</p>

<p>They had a little trouble with the
customs officials. This because nothing
unknown could be brought to
Earth without a thorough examination.</p>

<p>At the customs office, a bespectacled
official stared at Black
Eyes, scratching his head. "Never
seen one like that before."</p>

<p>"Neither have I," Judd admitted.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll look in the book." The
man did, but there are no thorough
tomes on Venusian fauna. "Not
here."</p>

<p>"I could have told you."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to quarantine
it and study it. That means you
and your wife go into quarantine,
too. It could have something that's
catching."</p>

<p>"Absurd!" Lindy cried.</p>

<p>"Sorry, lady. I only work here."</p>

<p>"You and your bright ideas,"
Judd told his wife acidly. "We may
be quarantined a month until they
satisfy themselves about Black
Eyes."</p>

<p>The customs official shrugged his
bony shoulders, and Judd removed
a twenty-credit note from his pocket
and handed it to the man. "Will
this change your mind?"</p>

<p>"I should say not! You can't
bribe me, Mr. Whitney! You
can't&mdash;" The man yawned,
stretched languidly, smiled. "No, sir,
you can keep your money, Mr.
Whitney. Guess we don't have to
examine your pet after all. Mighty
cute little feller. Well, have fun
with it. Come on, move along now."
And, as they were departing with
Black Eyes, still not believing their
ears: "Darn this weather! Makes a
man so lazy...."</p>

<p>It was after the affair at the
customs office, that Black Eyes uttered
its first sound. City life hasn't
changed much in the last fifty years.
Jet-cars still streak around the circumferential
highways, their whistles
blaring. Factories still belch
smoke and steam, although the new
atomic power plants have lessened
that to a certain extent. Crowds
still throng the streets, noisy, hurrying,
ill-mannered. It's one of those
things that can't be helped. A city
has to live, and it has to make noise.</p>

<p>But it seemed to frighten Lindy's
new pet. It stared through the jet-car
window on the way from the
spaceport to the Whitneys' suburban
home, its black eyes welling
with tears.</p>

<p>"Look!" Judd exclaimed. "Black
Eyes can cry!"</p>

<p>"A crying pet, Judd. I knew
there would be something unusual
about Black Eyes, I just knew it!"</p>

<p>The tears in the big black eyes
overflowed and tumbled out, rolling
down Black Eyes' silvery cheeks.
And then Black Eyes whimpered. It
was only a brief whimper, but both
Judd and Lindy heard it, and even
the driver turned around for a moment
and stared at the animal.</p>

<p>The driver stopped the jet. He
yawned and rested his head comfortably
on the cushioned seat. He
went quietly to sleep.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;man named</span> Merrywinkle
owned the Merrywinkle Shipping
Service. That, in itself, was not unusual.
But at precisely the moment
that Black Eyes unleashed its mild
whimper, Mr. Merrywinkle&mdash;uptown
and five miles away&mdash;called
an emergency conference of the
board of directors and declared:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, we have all been
working too hard, and I, for one,
am going to take a vacation. I don't
know when I'll be back, but it
won't be before six months."</p>

<p>"But C.M.," someone protested.
"There's the Parker deal and the
Gilette contract and a dozen other
things. You're needed!"</p>

<p>Mr. Merrywinkle shook his bald
head. "What's more, you're all taking
vacations, with pay. Six
months, each of you. We're closing
down Merrywinkle Shipping for
half a year. Give the competition a
break, eh?"</p>

<p>"But C.M.! We're about ready
to squeeze out Chambers Parcel
Co.! They'll get back on their feet
in six months."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Notify all departments
of the shut-down, effective
immediately. Vacations for all."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Who shut</span> off the assembly
belt?" the foreman asked mildly.
He was not a mild man and he
usually stormed and ranted at the
slightest provocation. This was at
Clewson Jetcraft, and you couldn't
produce a single jet-plane without
the assembly belt, naturally.</p>

<p>A plump little man said, "I did."</p>

<p>"But why?" the foreman asked
him, smiling blandly.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I just did."</p>

<p>The foreman was still smiling. "I
don't blame you."</p>

<p>Two days later, Clewson Jetcraft
had to lay off all its help.
They put ads in all the papers seeking
new personnel but no one
showed up. Clewson was forced to
shut down.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The crack</span> Boston to New
York pneumo-tube commuter's
special pulled to a bone-jarring
stop immediately outside the New
York station. Some angry commuters
pried open the conductor's
cab, and found the man snoozing
quite contentedly. They awakened
him, but he refused to drive the
train any further. All the commuters
had to leave the pneumo-train
and edge their way along
three miles of catwalk to the station.
No one was very happy about
it, but the feeling of well-being
which came over them all nipped
any possible protest in the bud.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Black Eyes</span> whimpered again
when Judd and Lindy reached
home but after that it was quiet. It
just sat on its haunches near the
window and stared out at the city.</p>

<p>The quiet city.</p>

<p>Nothing moved in the streets.
Nothing stirred. People remained
at home watching local video or
the new space-video from Mars. At
first it was a good joke, and the
newspapers could have had a field
day with it, had the newspapers remained
in circulation. After four
days, however, they suspended publication.
On the fifth day, there was
a shortage of food in the city, great
stores of it spoiling in the warehouses.
Heat and light failed after
a week, and the fire department ignored
all alarms a day later.</p>

<p>But everything did not stop.
School teachers still taught their
classes; clerks still sold whatever
goods were left on local shelves.
Librarians were still at their desks.</p>

<p>Conservatives said it was a
liberal plot to undermine capital
and demand higher wages; liberals
said big business could afford the
temporary layoff and wanted to
squeeze out the small businessman
and labor unions.</p>

<p>Scientists pondered and city officials
made speeches over video.</p>

<p>"Something," one of them observed,
"has hit our city. Work that
requires anything above a modicum
of sound has become impossible; in
regards to such work people have
become lazy. No one can offer any
valid suggestions concerning the
malady. It merely exists. However,
if a stop is not put to it&mdash;and soon&mdash;our
fair city will disintegrate.
Something is making us lazy, and
that laziness can spell doom, being
a compulsive lack of desire to create
any noise or disturbance. If anyone
believes he has the solution, he
should contact the Department of
Science at once. If you can't use
the video-phone, come in person.
But come! Every hour which passes
adds to the city's woes."</p>

<p>Nothing but scatter-brained ideas
for a week, none of them worth
consideration. Then the bespectacled
customs official who had bypassed
quarantine for Black Eyes,
got in touch with the authorities.
He had always been a conscientious
man&mdash;except for that one lapse.
Maybe the queer little beast had
nothing to do with this crisis. But
then again, the customs official
had never before&mdash;or since&mdash;had
that strange feeling of lassitude.
Could there be some connection?</p>

<p>A staff of experts on extra-terrestrial
fauna was dispatched to the
Whitney residence, although, indeed,
the chairman of the Department
of Science secretly considered
the whole idea ridiculous.</p>

<p>The staff of experts introduced
themselves. Then, ignoring the
protests of Lindy, went to work on
Black Eyes. At first Judd thought
the animal would object, but apparently
it did not. While conditions
all about them in the city
worsened, the experts spent three
days studying Black Eyes.</p>

<p>They found nothing out of the
ordinary.</p>

<p>Black Eyes merely stared back at
them, and but for an accident, they
would have departed without a
lead. On the third day, a huge
mongrel dog which belonged to
the Whitneys' next-door neighbors
somehow slipped its leash. It was a
fierce and ugly animal, and it was
known to attack anything smaller
than itself. It jumped the fence and
landed in Judd Whitney's yard. A
few loping bounds took it through
an open window, ground level. Inside,
it spied Black Eyes and made
for the creature at once, howling
furiously.</p>

<p>Black Eyes didn't budge.</p>

<p>And the mongrel changed its
mind! The slavering tongue withdrew
inside the chops, the howling
stopped. The mongrel lay down on
the floor and whined. Presently it
lost all interest, got to its feet, and
left as it had come.</p>

<p>Other animals were brought to
the Whitney home. Cats. Dogs. A
lion from the city zoo, starved for
two days and brought in a special
mobile cage by its keeper. Black
Eyes was thrust into the cage and
the lion gave forth with a hideous
yowling. Soon it stopped, rolled
over, and slept.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The scientists</span> correlated
their reports, returned with them
to the Whitney house. The leader,
whose name was Jamison, said:
"As closely as we can tell, Black
Eyes is the culprit."</p>

<p>"What?" Lindy demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Whitney. Your pet,
Black Eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't believe it!"</p>

<p>But Judd said, "Go ahead, Dr.
Jamison. I'm listening."</p>

<p>"Well, how does an animal&mdash;any
animal&mdash;protect itself?"</p>

<p>"Why, in any number of ways. If
it has claws or a strong jaw and
long teeth, it can fight. If it is fleet
of foot, it can run. If it is big and
has a tough hide, most other animals
can't hurt it anyway. Umm-mm,
doesn't that about cover it?"</p>

<p>"You left out protective coloration,
defensive odors, and things
like that. Actually, those are most
important from our point of view,
for Black Eyes' ability is a further
ramification of that sort of thing.
Your pet is not fast. It isn't strong.
It can't change color and it has no
offensive odor to chase off predatory
enemies. It has no armor. In
short, can you think of a more helpless
creature to put down in those
Venusian swamps?"</p>

<p>After Judd had shaken his head,
Dr. Jamison continued: "Very
well, Black Eyes should not be able
to survive on Venus&mdash;and yet, obviously
the creature did. We can
assume there are more of the breed,
too. Anyway, Black Eyes survives.
And I'll tell you why.</p>

<p>"Black Eyes has a very uncommon
ability to sense danger when
it approaches. And sensing danger,
Black Eyes can thwart it. Your
creature sends out certain emanations&mdash;I
won't pretend to know
what they are&mdash;which stamp aggression
out of any predatory creatures.
Neither of you could fire
upon it&mdash;right?"</p>

<p>"Umm-mm, that's true," Judd
said.</p>

<p>Lindy nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, that's one half of it.
There's so much about life we don't
understand. Black Eyes uses energy
of an unknown intensity, and the
result maintains Black Eyes' life.
Now, although that is the case,
your animal did not live a comfortable
life in the Venusian
swamp. Because no animal would
attack it, it could not be harmed.
Still, from what you tell me about
that swamp ...</p>

<p>"Anyhow, Black Eyes was glad
to come away with you, and everything
went well until you landed in
New York. The noises, the clattering,
the continual bustle of a great
city&mdash;all this frightened the creature.
It was being attacked&mdash;or, at
least that's what it must have figured.
Result: it struck back the
only way it knew how. Have you
ever heard about sub-sonic sound-waves,
Mr. Whitney, waves of
sound so low that our ears cannot
pick them up&mdash;waves of sound
which can nevertheless stir our
emotions? Such things exist, and, as
a working hypothesis, I would say
Black Eyes' strange powers rest
along those lines. The whole city
is idle because Black Eyes is
afraid!"</p>

<p>In his exploration of Mars, of
Venus, of the Jovian moons, Judd
Whitney had seen enough of extra-terrestrial
life to know that virtually
anything was possible, and Black
Eyes would be no exception to that
rule.</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do?"
Judd demanded.</p>

<p>"Do? Why, we'll have to kill your
creature, naturally. You can set a
value on it and we will meet it, but
Black Eyes must die."</p>

<p>"No!" Lindy cried. "You can't
be sure, you're only guessing, and
it isn't fair!"</p>

<p>"My dear woman, don't you
realize this is a serious situation?
The city's people will starve in
time. No one can even bring food
in because the trucks make too
much noise! As an alternative, we
could evacuate, but is your pet
more valuable than the life of a
great city?"</p>

<p>"N-no...."</p>

<p>"Then, please! Listen to reason!"</p>

<p>"Kill it," Judd said. "Go ahead."</p>

<p>Dr. Jamison withdrew from his
pocket a small blasting pistol used
by the Department of Domestic
Animals for elimination of injured
creatures. He advanced on Black
Eyes, who sat on its haunches in the
center of the room, surveying the
scientist.</p>

<p>Dr. Jamison put his blaster away.
"I can't," he said. "I don't want
to."</p>

<p>Judd smiled. "I know it. No one&mdash;no
<i>thing</i>&mdash;can kill Black Eyes.
You said so yourself. It was a waste
of time to try it. In that case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In that case," Dr. Jamison finished
for him, "we're helpless.
There isn't a man&mdash;or an animal&mdash;on
Earth that will destroy this
thing. Wait a minute&mdash;does it sleep,
Mr. Whitney?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. At least, I
never saw it sleep. And your team
of scientists, did they report anything?"</p>

<p>"No. As far as they could see, the
creature never slept. We can't catch
it unawares."</p>

<p>"Could you anesthetize it?"</p>

<p>"How? It can sense danger, and
long before you could do that, it
would stop you. It's only made one
mistake, Mr. Whitney: it believes
the noises of the city represent a
danger. And that's only a negative
mistake. Noise won't hurt Black
Eyes, of course. It simply makes the
animal unnecessarily cautious. But
we cannot anesthetize it any more
than we can kill it."</p>

<p>"I could take it back to Venus."</p>

<p>"Could you? Could you? I
hadn't thought of that."</p>

<p>Judd shook his head. "I can't."</p>

<p>"What do you mean you can't?"</p>

<p>"It won't let me. Somehow it can
sense our thoughts when we think
something it doesn't want. I can't
take it to Venus! No man could, because
it doesn't want to go."</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Whitney&mdash;do you
mean to say you believe it can
<i>think</i>?"</p>

<p>"Uh-uh. Didn't say that. It can
sense our thoughts, and that's
something else again."</p>

<p>Dr. Jamison threw his hands up
over his head in a dramatic gesture.
"It's hopeless," he said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Things grew</span> worse. New
York crawled along to a standstill.
People began to move from
the city. In trickles, at first, but the
trickles became torrents, as New
York's ten million people began to
depart for saner places. It might
take months&mdash;it might even take
years, but the exodus had begun.
Nothing could stop it. Because of a
harmless little beast with the eyes
of a tarsier, the life of a great city
was coming to an end.</p>

<p>Word spread. Scientists all over
the world studied reports on Black
Eyes. No one had any ideas. Everyone
was stumped. Black Eyes had
no particular desire to go outside.
Black Eyes merely remained in the
Whitney house, contemplating
nothing in particular, and stopping
everything.</p>

<p>Dr. Jamison, however, was a persistent
man. Judd got a letter from
him one day, and the following
afternoon he kept his appointment
with the scientist.</p>

<p>"It's good to get out," Judd said,
after a three hour walk to the Department
of Science Building. "I
can go crazy just staring at that
thing."</p>

<p>"I have it, Whitney."</p>

<p>"You have what? Not the way to
destroy Black Eyes? I don't believe
it!"</p>

<p>"It's true. Consider. Everyone in
the world does not yet know of your
pet, correct?"</p>

<p>"I suppose there are a few people
who don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are many. Among them,
are the crew of a jet-bomber which
has been on maneuvers in Egypt.
We have arranged everything."</p>

<p>"Yes? How?"</p>

<p>"At noon tomorrow, the bomber
will appear over your home with
one of the ancient, high-explosive
missiles. Your neighbors will be removed
from the vicinity, and, precisely
at twelve-o-three in the afternoon,
the bomb will be dropped.
Your home will be destroyed. Black
Eyes will be destroyed with it."</p>

<p>Judd looked uncomfortable. "I
dunno," he said. "Sounds too easy."</p>

<p>"Too easy? I doubt if the animal
will ever sense what is going on&mdash;not
when the crew of the bomber
doesn't know, either. They'll consider
it a mighty peculiar order, to
destroy one harmless, rather large
and rather elaborate suburban
home. But they'll do it. See you tomorrow,
Whitney, after this mess is
behind us."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Judd said. "Yeah." But
somehow, the scientist had failed to
instill any of his confidence in
Judd.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">With Lindy</span>, he left home at
eleven the following morning,
after making a thorough list of all
their properties which the City had
promised to duplicate. Judd did
not look at Black Eyes as he left,
and the animal remained where it
was, seated on its haunches under
the dining room table, nibbling
crumbs. Judd could almost feel the
big round eyes boring a pair of twin
holes in his back, and he dared not
turn around to face them....</p>

<p>They were a mile away at
eleven forty-five, making their way
through the nearly deserted streets.
Judd stopped walking. He looked
at Lindy. Lindy looked at him.</p>

<p>"They're going to destroy it," he
said.</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Do you want them to?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Judd knew that something had
to be done with Black Eyes. He
didn't like the little beast, and, anyway,
that had nothing to do with it.
Black Eyes was a menace. And yet,
something whispered in Judd's ear,
<i>Don't let them, don't let them ...</i>
It wasn't Judd and it wasn't Judd's
subconscious. It was Black Eyes,
and he knew it. But he couldn't do
a thing about it&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm going to stay right here and
let them bomb the place," he said
aloud. But as he spoke, he was running
back the way he had come.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>He sprinted part of the time,
then rested, then sprinted again. He
was somewhat on the beefy side and
he could not run fast, but he made
it. Just.</p>

<p>He heard the jet streaking
through the sky overhead, looked
up once and saw it circling. Two
blocks from his house he was met
by a policeman. The entire area
had been roped off, and the officer
shook his head when Judd tried to
get through.</p>

<p>"But I live there!"</p>

<p>"Can't help it, Mister. Orders is
orders."</p>

<p>Judd hit him. Judd didn't want
to, but nevertheless, he grunted
with satisfaction when he felt the
blow to be a good one, catching the
stocky officer on the point of his
chin and tumbling him over backwards.
Then Judd was ducking under
the rope and running.</p>

<p>He reached his house, plummeted
in through the front door.
He found Black Eyes under the
kitchen table, squatting on its
haunches. He scooped the animal
up, ran outside. Then he was running
again, and before he reached
the barrier, something rocked him.
A loud series of explosions ripped
through his brain, and instinctively&mdash;Black
Eyes' instincts, not his&mdash;he
folded his arms over the animal,
protecting it. Something shuddered
and began to fall behind him, and
debris scattered in all directions.
Something struck Judd's head and
he felt the ground slapping up
crazily at his face&mdash;</p>

<p>He was as good as new a few
days later.</p>

<p>And so was Black Eyes.</p>

<p>"I have it," Judd said to his
nurse.</p>

<p>"You have what, sir?"</p>

<p>"It's so simple, so ridiculously
simple, maybe that's why no one
ever thought of it. Get me Dr.
Jamison!"</p>

<p>Jamison came a few moments
later, breathless. "Well?"</p>

<p>"I have the solution."</p>

<p>"You ... do?" Not much hope
in the answer. Dr. Jamison was a
tired, defeated man.</p>

<p>"Sure. Black Eyes doesn't like the
city. Fine. Take him out. I can't
take him to Venus. He doesn't like
Venus and he won't go. No one
can take him anyplace he doesn't
want to go, just as no one can hurt
him in any way. But he doesn't like
the city. It's too noisy. All right:
have someone take him far from
the city, far far away&mdash;where
there's no noise at all. Someplace
out in the sticks where it won't
matter much if Black Eyes puts a
stop to any disturbing noises."</p>

<p>"Who will take him? You, Mr.
Whitney?"</p>

<p>Judd shook his head. "That's
your job, not mine. I've given you
the answer. Now use it."</p>

<p>Lindy had arrived, and Lindy
said: "Judd, you're right. That <i>is</i>
the answer. And you're wonderful&mdash;"</p>

<p>No one volunteered to spend his
life in exile with Black Eyes, but
then Dr. Jamison pointed out that
while no one knew the creature's
life-span, it certainly couldn't be
expected to match man's. Just a
few years and the beast would die,
and ... Dr. Jamison's arguments
were so logical that he convinced
himself. He took Black Eyes with
him into the Canadian Northwoods,
and there they live.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Judd</span> was right&mdash;almost.</p>

<p>This was the obvious answer
which escaped everyone.</p>

<p>But scientists continued their
examinations of Black Eyes, and
they discovered something. Black
Eyes' fears had not been for herself
alone. She is going to have babies.
The estimate is for thirty-five little
tarsier-eyed creatures. No doctor in
the world will be able to do anything
but deliver the litter.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
